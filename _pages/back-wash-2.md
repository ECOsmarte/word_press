<h2>Now we will explain what backwashing is, when to do it, and what happens it is done too frequently or not enough.</h2>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Backwashing releases that pressure by removing the debris from the filter and out through an exit hose. Resting pressure is measured as the pressure in the filter just after a backwash. By backwashing whenever the pressure rises more than 6-10lbs of pressure higher than the resting pressure, you are sure to prevent any damage to the pump. If you backwash too often, then the pressure will never rise high enough to collect the finer particles of debris. However if you never backwash, and pressure rises to 10-14 lbs higher than the resting pressure, the circulation will slow down and you will put the pump in danger. Lastly, if phosphate remover is added to the pool to reduce phosphate level, the filter must be backwashed 48 hours afterwards regardless of current pressure on the filter. The exception to this is ECOsmarte ZERO Backwash which is applied by bug sprayers.</p>
