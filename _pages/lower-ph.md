<h1>Lowering pH Levels</h1>
<br><h3>pH levels need to be within 6.8 – 7.2.  6.8 is the ideal level.<br><br><strong>How does HIGH pH affect my pool?</strong></h3>
<br><br><h4 align="left">A pH above 7.2 renders the copper a less effective sanitizer, which can lead to algae growth and other sanitation issues. A high pH can also lead to “copper fall out.” Copper fall out is when the copper falls out of its ION form and returns to a solid state. This can cause your pool water to appear blue in color and can also cause “plating.” Plating is when copper deposits itself to the surface of your pool causing bluish deposits. Thankfully, these deposits are not permanent.
Dropping your pH down to 6.8 (and maintaining a lower copper level of .5 ppm) will allow the copper to fall back into its desired ION form.</h4>
<br><br><h2>To Lower the pH Level:</h2>

</center>
<ol>
<li>Fill a 5 gallon bucket about halfway with pool water.  Then, add liquid muriatic acid to the bucket, creating a solution of about 2 parts water to one part acid.</li>
<li>Walk around the pool gradually adding the acid/water solution evenly to the pool.</li>
<li>Wait a day for the solution to mix thoroughly, and then test the pH again.  If the pH is still above 7.2, add another dose of water/acid solution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>pH needs to be 6.8 - 7.2<br><br>Tips for pH management:</h2>
</center>
<ol>
<li>The higher the pH is, the more acid is required, exponentially, to bring it down.  Err on the side of using more acid to bring the pH down more quickly. The pH will always tend to correct itself upward if it does get too low.</li>
<li>The trick for extreme stability is keeping the pH around 6.8, and not letting it get above 7.0.</li>
<li>ECOsmarte only recommends using liquid muriatic acid or a product called "Acid Magic" to lower pH. Never use dry acid.</li>
