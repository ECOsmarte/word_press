<h1>Testing Copper Levels</h1>
<br><h3>Test the pH level first. Adjust pH to 6.8-7.2 if needed before testing Copper levels.</h3>

<ol>
<li>With a clean, dry sample tube, take a sample of water about 18" below the water - away from return jets and skimmers.</li>
<li>Add 5 drops of Copper A to the tube, cap it, and turn it upside-down to mix.</li>
<li>Add 5 drops of Copper B to the same tube, cap it, and turn it upside-down to mix.</li>
<li>Wait three minutes.</li>
<li>With the color chart on a flat surface, hold the tube about 1" above the chart. Look down through the length of the tube and compare to the color chart.</li>
<li>Record Results. The pool must have a copper level between .4 - .7ppm. On a 20,000 gallon pool, it takes, on average, 4 hours to move .1ppm and 12 hours to move .3ppm.</li>
</ol>

<br><br><h3><strong>How does the pH of my pool affect my Copper Test?</strong></h3>
</center>
<br><br><h4 align="left">A pH reading above 7.2 is going to give you a FALSE LOW copper reading, meaning you may have an optimum copper level even though the test says you do not. 
Adjust the pH down below 7.2 (ideally 6.8) and retest the copper.
<br>A pH reading below 6.8 is going to give you a FALSE HIGH copper reading, meaning you may not have an optimum copper level even though the test says you do.  
Low pH will tend to correct itself on its own.  However, you can adjust the pH up to 6.8 using baking soda.</h4>
