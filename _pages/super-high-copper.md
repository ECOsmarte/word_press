<h2>	High copper levels can be caused by some simple but common mistakes:</h2>
</center>
<ol>
<li>Check the chamber to ensure that the water flows through the copper first, then the titanium, meaning the water hits thin black plates last before heading to the pool.  Copper electrodes must be closest to the pump.</li>
<li>Never ionize or oxidize when water is not flowing.  For programmable systems, make sure “OXY” and “ION” start and end times are set within the “POOL” start and end times, or no power will be delivered.</li>
<li>Make sure the pool is not being over-ionized.  Only ionize once per week.</li>
<li>Metallic Algaecide can cause high copper.  Instead, use any algaecide with a 40 or 60 on the bottle - Algaecide Poly 60 is most commonly used.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><center>
<h2>To lower the copper level:</h2>
</center>
<ol>
<li>Drain 2 feet of water from the pool and refill.</li>
<li>Retest the copper.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<br><br><h2>If the copper level is still above .7ppm, drain another 2 feet and refill.</h2>
