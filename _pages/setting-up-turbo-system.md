<!--STARTING UP A NEW Pool SYSTEM-->
<h1>Setting up a new Pool System</h1>
<br><h3>Start by taking your water tests. Open up the large black case and look for your four main test kits.</h3>
</center>
<ol>
<li>Test the pH. If the PH is high, add some liquid muriatic acid to lower the pH to 6.8</li>
<li>Test the copper level. You should get a copper reading of 0ppm before start-up. The pump and filter should run 24 to 48 hours in the ionize mode.</li>
<li>Test the calcium level. The optimal level is 400ppm or higher. Calcium is also known as hardness.</li>
<li>Test the phosphate level. Remember that the correct level of phosphates should be 0ppb.</li> 
</ol>
