<center>The 4 Chemical Levels of ECOsmarte and their Constraints</center>&nbsp;

<center><img src="http://ecosmartecloud.com/wp-admin/php/eco_res/round_button_phos.png" alt="" /></center>&nbsp;
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The fourth and last level is phosphates. Phosphates in simplest terms are food for algae, and by reducing the phosphates to zero, the fuel for algae is eliminated. The correct level for phosphates is between 0-100ppb, leaning towards 0. If phosphates are too high, then algae will begin to grow in the pool provided there are active live algae. If a portable kit shows 100ppb or higher it is recommended you get a digital test of the pool store.</p>
