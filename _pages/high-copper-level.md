<h2>If chlorine was added to the pool while the copper level was up, and is the reason for the staining, the pool needs to be <a href = "http://ecosmartecloud.com/peroxide-wash/" target="blankd">drained and washed with hydrogen peroxide.</a><br><br> If chlorine is not the reason for the staining, follow these steps eliminate the staining:</h2>
</center>
<ol>
<li>Drain 2 feet of water and refill to lower the copper level to below .3 ppm.</li>
<li>Raise the water level up over the top of the staining.</li>
<li>Add enough acid to lower the pH to 6.0 or lower.</li>
<li>After about 12 hours, test the copper level.  If the copper level is .7 or higher, drain and refill another 2 feet of water. </li>
<li>Once all the stains are gone, raise the pH with borax (4 - 8 lbs per day) until the pH is back up to 6.8.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><h2>If the stains are NOT gone within 3 days, drain the pool and wash it with hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the stains.</h2>
