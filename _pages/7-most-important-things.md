<h1>7 MOST IMPORTANT THINGS</h1>
&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>The ECOsmarte Pool system should be set to run ONLY when the pool is turned on. DO NOT TURN ON THE ECOSMARTE POOL SYSTEM WHEN THE POOL IS OFF.</li>
 	<li>The Security Sequence for the Programmable Control Box is UP DOWN UP (arrow keys after touching amp key).</li>
 	<li>pH is the most important thing. Make sure that your pH is 6.8 - 7.2. Having the pH level at 6.8 is better than 7.2. Check the pH twice a week to start.</li>
 	<li>You must maintain a copper level between .4 - .7ppm.</li>
 	<li>Calcium should be at least 400ppm. Confirm that your calcium is at the right level two to three times per year and after rain and heavy storms.</li>
 	<li>The phosphate level should be at 0ppb. A digital test every month or two is recommended.</li>
 	<li>Replace the test kits every two years.</li>
</ol>
