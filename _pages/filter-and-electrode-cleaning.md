<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sand Filter Vessel Wash and Cleaning (With Sand Or Glass Pack Media):</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">** Bleach Treat a Sand or Glass Pack Media Filter</h3>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>If you have sand or Glass Pack media in sand filter vessel from last year/season or have not bleach treated in the last year, complete a filter media bleach or acid treatment cycle in the spring upon pool start up.</li>
	<li>If you have sand media inside sand filter vessel, consider replacing it with Glass Pack media. 10X performance improvement filtration to 2-5 microns vs 50 microns with sand. 10 Year Life with GlassPack vs 1-3 years with sand. Backwash every 4-6 weeks with Glass Pack vs 1-2 weeks with sand. Save water, energy, money, hassle and get clearer water with Glass Pack media.</li>
	<li>Backwash Filter 2.5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Rinse Filter 30 seconds or until sight glass clear.</li>
	<li>Loosen filter diverter valve collar screw, remove it, open and inspect filter, Unscrew the drain plug.</li>
	<li>Drain the water until the media is visible. ( This may take a while.) Replace the drain plug.</li>
	<li>Remove any debris.</li>
	<li>Make sure media is within 10-12″ of the top. Add media as necessary.</li>
	<li>Pour 2 gallons bleach per 300LB of Glass Pack media in filter.  Pour 2 gallons bleach or liquid muriatic acid per 300LB of sand media in filter.</li>
	<li>Wait 8-12 hours with pump off. Then put filter valve back together.</li>
	<li>Backwash Filter 2.5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Rinse Filter 30 seconds or until sight glass clear.</li>
</ol>

	<li>Have the DE filter broken down for cleaning and checked for broken grids.</li>
	<li>Remove the grids.</li>
	<li>Soak the grids in a 2 parts water to 1 part liquid muriatic acid solution for 12 hours. (Soaking grids is critical twice yearly.)</li>
	<li>Reassemble the grids.</li>
	<li>Add DE powder per instructions.</li>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">How and When to Clean the Electrodes</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The electrodes in a pool system need to be cleaned 2 times per year. Also clean them if there is visible build-up on the electrodes. DO NOT TAKE THE ELECTRODES OUT OF THE CHAMBER TO CLEAN THEM. Remove the entire chamber and place it in an acid and water solution, 5 parts water and one part acid.</h3>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Make sure the pump and filter are off and the valves are closed.</li>
	<li>Slip the wires off of the metal tabs on the outside of the chamber and unscrew the chamber from the return line. If the unions don't loosen by hand, try a strap wrench. Be careful not to crack the chamber.</li>
	<li>In a 5 gallon bucket, mix a solution of 5 parts water to 1 part acid. Pour the water in first and then the acid.</li>
	<li>Place the entire electrode chamber in the solution for 10-15 minutes. Allow the solution to do the work.</li>
	<li>If the chamber isn't clean after 10-15 minutes, let the chamber soak longer, but not longer than about 1 hour.</li>
	<li>Do not scrub or scrap the electrodes. Using tools to scrape the electrodes will damage them.</li>
	<li>Remove the chamber from the solution and rinse in fresh water.</li>
	<li>Replace the chamber inline and hand tighten the unions.</li>
	<li>Replace the wires on the chamber. Red and green wires go to the copper electrodes and the black and white wires go to the titanium electrodes.</li>
</ol>
