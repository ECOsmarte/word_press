<h2>When the pH is very low and the water is a bright lime green, but crystal clear, the alkalinity is low.
<br>To raise the alkalinity:</h2>
</center>
<ol>
<li>Add 4 lbs baking soda to the pool.</li>
<li>After 24 hours, retest the pH.</li>
<li>If the pH level still lower than 6.6, add another 4 lbs baking soda. </li>
<li>A total of 8 lbs baking soda should be enough to raise the pH to 6.8 - 7.2.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<h2>Aim for the low end of the range to avoid causing a pH "bounce" that is hard to correct.</h2>
